## **Express API template**


###### **What was my motivation?**

I realized that every time I'm in a MERN project or a project with flutter or react native..., 
I have to create an api for the backend. we agree that it takes time to install the environment and configure it ðŸ˜­. 
the real reason why I made this api is that the process is repetitive ðŸ’€.

###### **What you will learn?**

In this project you will learn how to create the beginning of an api 
or to use a basic project that will facilitate the creation of your api (that will allow you to save time). 
As **prerequisite**, 
you must know [Javascript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) (it's a wonderful programming language ðŸ¤Ÿ),
nodejs to build server.

2. Open the project with an IDE(webstorm, vscode .....)
3. In the **terminal** of your ide type **_npm install_**
4. Create file **_.env_** to the root of the folder, 
5. inside this file add **_PORT=9000_** don't leave any space between PORT(always in capital letters ) and equal
6. Look for the **TODO** in the project and fill in the tasks(it's very important)
7. After npm install, type **_npm run nodemon_** to launch the server
8. Yeah â˜º, you did it. Now continue your project.
