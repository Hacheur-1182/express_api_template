## **Express API template**


###### **What was my motivation?**

I realized that every time I'm in a MERN project or a project with flutter or react native..., 
I have to create an api for the backend. we agree that it takes time to install the environment and configure it ðŸ˜­. 
the real reason why I made this api is that the process is repetitive ðŸ’€.

###### **What did you learn?**

In this project you will learn how to create the beginning of an api 
or to use a basic project that will facilitate the creation of your api (that will allow you to save time). 
As **prerequisite**, 
you must know [Javascript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) (it's a wonderful programming language ðŸ¤Ÿ),
nodejs to build server.

###### **How to use this project**

###### **_overall approach_**
1. First time clone and extract the project
2. open the project with an IDE(webstorm, vscode .....)
3. in the **terminal** of your ide type **_npm install_**
4. look for the **TODO** in the project and fill in the tasks(it's very important)
5. after npm install, type **_npm run nodemon_** to launch the server
6. yeah â˜º, you did it. Now continue your project.

###### **_in webstorm ide_**

1. press file, new then project from version control
2. copy and paste link inside the url
3. choose your directory and press clone
4. after the process open ide _**terminal**_ and type **_npm install_** 
5. press **_Add Configuration_**, **_Add new_**, npm, scripts and select nodemon.
