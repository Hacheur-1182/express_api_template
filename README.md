## **Express API template**


###### **What was my motivation?**

I realized that every time I'm in a MERN project or a project with flutter or react native..., 
I have to create an api for the backend. we agree that it takes time to install the environment and configure it 😭. 
the real reason why I made this api is that the process is repetitive 💀.

###### **What did you learn?**

In this project you will learn how to create the beginning of an api 
or to use a basic project that will facilitate the creation of your api (that will allow you to save time). 
As **prerequisite**, 
you must know [Javascript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) (it's a wonderful programming language 🤟),
nodejs to build server.

###### **How to use this project**

###### **_overall approach_**
1. First time clone and extract the project
2. Open the project with an IDE(webstorm, vscode .....)
3. In the **terminal** of your ide type **_npm install_**
4. Create file **_.env_** inside this file add **_PORT=9000_** don't leave any space between PORT(always in capital letters ) and equal
5. Look for the **TODO** in the project and fill in the tasks(it's very important)
6. After npm install, type **_npm run nodemon_** to launch the server
7. Yeah ☺, you did it. Now continue your project.

###### **_In Webstorm IDE_**

1. Press _file_, _New_ then _project from version control_
2. Copy and paste link (the GitHub of this project: https://github.com/Hacheur-1182/express_api_template.git)
3. Choose your _directory_ and press _clone_.
4. Open IDE _**terminal**_ and type **_npm install_** 
5. After the installation of the packages, Press **_Add Configuration_**, **_Add new_**, npm, scripts and select nodemon.
